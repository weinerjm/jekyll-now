title: Recurrent Neural Network for Generating Random Pokemon Names
---

Yesterday and today I spent a great deal of time setting up an AWS EC2 instance for the [Pokemon name generator](http://pokegen.crabdance.com). 
It was a pain. 

I had been waiting to activate my free year of AWS until I had a suitable project. 
I couldn't deploy this web app to Heroku or EBS because I wanted to install Torch7 to generate output from the trained RNN model. I suppose I could find a Python implementation of an RNN instead but I assume it would run a lot slower than the great torch-rnn library.
Initially, I had wanted to use a server with a GPU to train the model more quickly (my desktop with a good GPU is in a state of suspended animation) but the AWS free tier doesn't cover that. 

I tried following some detailed instructions for setting up an instance of uWSGI and nginx on my EC2 instance but it didn't work very well.
