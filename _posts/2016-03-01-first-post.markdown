Hello, world! Finally, I'm Web-2.0ing myself. Perhaps I can use this platform as some kind of self-promotion springboard without actually doing much work.

Testing things: a useful website is [Google][goog]. Here is some code:

{% highlight python %}
def f(x):
    return 2*x
f(2)
#=> returns 4
{% endhighlight %}

[goog]: https://www.google.com
