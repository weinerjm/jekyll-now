I am a physicist by training, but I've always liked learning new things. In fact, I liked school so much that I have been in school for about 90% of my life. 

I most recently got my Ph.D. in experimental quantum optics under the direction of [James Thompson](https://jila.colorado.edu/thompson/) at [JILA](http://jila.colorado.edu). My thesis work focused on generating correlations between about a million cold atoms within an optical cavity--techniques that will be useful for future atomic sensors. James is a great advisor and my fellow graduate students were excellent colleagues.

Prior to that, I stayed up late doing homework at Caltech in Pasadena, California. I graduated in 2009. 

Even more prior to _that_, I grew up in a quaint town in Massachusetts. I have lived in a lot of great places.

Nowadays I spend my time as a "freelance educator" (tutor), specializing in physics, math, and programming. I live in Denver, Colorado.

### More About Me
I like to ski, bike, and hike.  

Last year, I embarked on a very long trip (96 days) across Europe with my girlfriend. I'll post a link to that blog "soon."
